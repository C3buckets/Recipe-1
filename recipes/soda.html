        </div>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <div class="section">
        <ul>
            <li>1 lb. strawberries, rinsed, hulled, and diced</li>
            <li>1½ cups granulated sugar, (can use less if desired)</li>
            <li>1½ cups water</li>
            <li>2-3 teaspoon lemon juice (optional)</li>
            <li>Club Soda, chilled (or lemon-lime soda), *see note*</li>
         </ul>
        </div>
         <h3>Steps</h3>
         <div class="section">
         <ol>
             <li>Place the strawberries, water, and sugar in a large saucepan. Stir.</li>
             <li>Bring to a simmer over medium heat.</li>
             <li>When strawberries are soft, mash them with a potato masher.</li>
             <li>Let strawberries continue to simmer gently until the juices begin to reduce, thicken and become syrupy. (reduce heat if needed)</li>
             <li>Strain mixture through a mesh strainer, using a rubber spatula to press out the excess syrup. Discard the pulp. (You should have about 1 ¼ cups of syrup.)</li>
             <li>Stir in lemon juice if using. Let syrup mixture cool and then place in the refrigerator until chilled.</li>
             <li>To make a glass of soda, pour 8 oz of cold club soda into a cup. Stir in the chilled strawberry syrup by the tablespoon, tasting until you've reached your desired sweetness.</li>
            <h4>Notes</h4>
            <li>Place leftover syrup in a jar and store it in the fridge.</li>
            <li>This recipe makes about 1 1/4  cups of strawberry soda. Serving size depends on how many tablespoons of syrup you use per cup. (I usually like about 4-5 tablespoons per 8 oz club soda)</li>
            <li>You can also sub the carbonated water with Ginger-Ale or Lemon-lime soda. However, I feel this takes away from the fresh strawberry flavor.</li>
